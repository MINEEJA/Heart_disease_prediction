# Heart_disease_prediction- Predicting the heart disease using ML 
 ## The steps involved are,
 1. Data is loaded to the respective folder
 2. Exploratory data analysis and preparing the data for modelling
 3. Testing different models to find the best one,
      - Linear Support Vector Classification - LinearSVC()
      - Non-linear Support Vector Machines- NuSVC()
      - Logistic Regression - LogisticRegression()
      - K-Nearest Neighbors - KNeighboursClassifier()
      - RandomForest - RandomForestClassifier()
 4. Fine tuning the best model (Random Forest Classifier) using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV
